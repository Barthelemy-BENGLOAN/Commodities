The idea behind this project is to develop an effective investment strategyin the commodities sector by creating an index that replicates the performanceof major agricultural products
such as cocoa, sugar, cotton and coffee, while taking into account the influence of the oil index. The objective is
to better understand the correlations between these markets and how they can be used to optimise an investment portfolio.
